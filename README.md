Morphine Equivalents Dosage Calculator

No warranties at all for this open source project.  Feel free to inspect the code and deploy/use as you see fit.

The first round thresholds/formulas came from https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/calculating_total_daily_dose-a.pdf, which contains some ambiguity in the calculations, such as ambiguous specification of cut-off points.

This should mimic other MED calculators, such as http://www.agencymeddirectors.wa.gov/Calculator/DoseCalculator.htm
